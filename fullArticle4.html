			<h2> Beautiful Japanese nights </h2>
			<h1> Summary </h1>
			<p>Japans true colours come out at night. See for yourself the bright colours of lanterns, candles and other decorations bright life to Japanese streets at night!</p>
			
			<h1> Full Text </h1>
			<p>Japanese streets during the day are very pretty and clean. When I went to Japan I noticed that there were barely any bins for rubbish but somehow the streets were always clean which was very surprising. Buildings are colourful and have designs that are quite different to the ones in America
			and I thought they looked really nice but I just haven't even seen the best part</p>
			<p>At night Japan lights up. The lanterns that can be seen everywhere that are usually turned off at day time, turn on simultaneously at around 7pm. The huge variety in colours really makes Japan look alive at night time even more so than day time, especially at different celebrations when
			it gets dark enough for fireworks and the sky gets lighten up as well!</p>
			<p>The streets are always bright and there are no dark valleys that you would usually try to avoid as they are often an invitation to be robbed. I never felt more safe walking around at night as people seemed happy and bright and on the contrast of the bright colours it really made my mood better as well.</p>
			<p>Even though I felt safe, Japan still has criminals just like anywhere on the planet so try to be with someone. Walk around at night with your loved ones and you can really feel magic of those mesmerising lanterns and their warm bright colours.</p>
